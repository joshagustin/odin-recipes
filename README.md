Basic webpage for HTML practice

In this project I make use of the basic HTML tags to create a webpage showcasing different recipes.

## Learnings
- Be conscious of the use of headings as they aid users and search engines understand page structure.
- Make use of `<strong>` and `<em>` instead of `<b>` and `<i>` as the former adds both visual and oral emphasis to text. This aids those who use screen readers.
- Always use the `alt` attribute in images to make a webpage accessible to those with vision impairments.
- Prepend links with `./` as problems may arise from the lack of it. `./` refers to the current directory.
